# Final-Project-Bootcampspot

The final project for the data science and visualization bootcamp focuses on bikesharing programs in three of the largest cities in the US: New York City, Washington D.C. and Chicago. This project incorporate many of the tools that were taught in the program, including machine learning (natural language processing) and advanced web scraping tools and methods. The main objectives of this project were to use NLP to show the trends in the reviews (taken from Yelp and TripAdvisor) and compare the frequency of the kinds of reviews (good, neutral, bad). Another factor that was considered was the impact of weather on riding bikes- how does rain and snow determine whether or not someone would choose to ride their bike? Many of the visualizations were created using Tableau and the matplotlib library in Python.
